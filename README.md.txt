Heart Disease – Biomedical Informatics Analysis

Overview
This project explores a clinical heart disease dataset containing 1,025 patients and 14 variables. The objective is to demonstrate biomedical informatics principles such as data quality assessment, outcome stratification, and cautious clinical interpretation.

Key Steps
- Verified dataset completeness and variable integrity
- Analyzed disease prevalence and demographic patterns
- Examined age, blood pressure, and cholesterol differences by disease status
- Interpreted counter-intuitive findings in the context of treatment effects and real-world clinical bias
- Visualized disease distribution using a simple bar chart

Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

Key Learning
This project emphasizes informatics-focused thinking—understanding healthcare data within clinical and system-level context rather than relying solely on predictive modeling.
