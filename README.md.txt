Heart Disease – Biomedical Informatics Analysis

Overview
This project analyzes a clinical heart disease dataset comprising 1,025 patients and 14 variables. The objective is to apply biomedical informatics principles such as data quality assessment, outcome stratification, and cautious clinical interpretation, rather than focusing on predictive modeling.

Key Steps

Assessed dataset completeness and variable integrity
Examined disease prevalence and demographic patterns
Analyzed differences in age, blood pressure, and cholesterol by disease status
Interpreted counter-intuitive findings in the context of treatment effects and real-world clinical bias
Visualized disease distribution using simple, interpretable charts

Tools Used

Python
Pandas
Matplotlib

Key Learning
This project emphasizes informatics-driven thinking by interpreting healthcare data within clinical and system-level contexts, highlighting the importance of data quality, bias awareness, and cautious conclusions in biomedical datasets.
